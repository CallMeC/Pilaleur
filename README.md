# Pilaleur
This project was part of the 2018 Hackathon by 8Fablab. It was developped by a team of 6 people.
The goal is to develop a medical treatment dispenser for disabled / partially disabled people within 48h.
The public price was awarded to this project.

# Features
This dispenser is linked to a Google Home assistant. When a pill needs to be taken, a little box is opening with the pill inside.
Its design is as simple as possible to allow everyone to use it. It mixes shapes, colors and textures.
It is also very modular, every element is atatched to another thanks to magnets. Configuration can be changed easily.
